# Projekt Bussen

This Python script simulates a bus system with a variety of features.

Here's what the bus system can do:

Randomly generate passengers: Passengers are generated randomly with the properties of sex, age, and positions (sitting or standing). The total number of passengers generated at a time is also random with a maximum limit of 25 passengers.

Passenger embarkation and disembarkation: Passengers can get on and off the bus. The number of passengers getting off the bus at a time is also random.

Keep track of passengers: The script can print out a list of all passengers currently on the bus.

Age calculations: The script can calculate and print out the total combined age of all passengers on the bus as well as the average age of all passengers.

Passenger details: The script can find the oldest passenger on the bus and print out their details.

Sorting of passengers: The script can sort the list of passengers based on their age.

Find passengers within a specific age range: You can input an age range and the script will print out all passengers within that age range.

Count passengers by position: The script can count and print out the number of passengers who are sitting and standing.

Interact with passengers: There's an option to "poke" a passenger, which simulates an interaction with a selected passenger. The interaction varies based on the passenger's age and sex.

User-friendly menu: The script provides an interactive menu in the terminal for easy usage of all the above features. The user can choose to execute a feature or quit the program through this menu.

This simulation script is an interesting exploration of Python's object-oriented programming capabilities and random library. It's a good starting point for someone learning Python, especially about class usage, and the script can be easily modified to add more complex features or to simulate different scenarios.
